B. Key Terms<br/><br/>
In this privacy policy, these terms have the following meanings:<br/><br/>

“Contact” is a person a customer may contact through our Service. In other words, a Contact is anyone on a Member’s Distribution List about whom a Member has given us information or is anyone who has otherwise interacted with a Member via the Service. For example, if you are a Member, a subscriber to your email marketing campaigns or a shopper to your Website or Landing Page would be considered a Contact.<br/><br/>

“Distribution List” is a list of contact details and all associated information related to those contacts (for example, email addresses)<br/><br/>

“Personal Information” means any information that identifies or can be used to identify an individual directly or indirectly. Examples of Personal Information include, but are not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, email address, gender, occupation, or other demographic information.

“Visitor” means, depending on the context, any person who visits any of our uInvented websites, offices, or otherwise engages with us at our events or in connection with our marketing or recruitment activities.
<br/><br/>
“you” and “your” means, depending on the context, either a Customer, a Contact, or a Visitor.
<br/><br/>
2. Privacy for Customers
This section applies to the Personal Information we collect and process from a Customer or potential Customer through the provision of our services, including features offered through the Service.

<br/><br/>

We and our third-party marketing and advertising partners may use your Personal Information to serve you specifically, such as marketing information, product recommendations, non-transactional communications (e.g., email, telemarketing calls, SMS, or push notifications), and personalised advertising about us, in accordance with your applicable marketing preferences and this privacy policy.

<br/><br/>

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection law. We may ask you to verify your identity in order to help us respond efficiently to your request.
